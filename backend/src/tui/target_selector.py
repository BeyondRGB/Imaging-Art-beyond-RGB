""" target_selector.py
Routine for generating the target coordinates from a target image. This routine
prompts the user to select the target using an cv2 window in which a selector
can be dragged over the image creating a selection area.
Functions:
    __scale_img()
    __mouse_select()
    __draw_target()
    select_target()
